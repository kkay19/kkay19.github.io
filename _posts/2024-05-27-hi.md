<h1>guys i exist!!</h1>

<div class="blog-content">
Welcome welcome to the official kaykay19 site blog!! Here you'll find a lot of interesting stuff, but I think it'll mostly be cat art. So yeah, enjoy! I'm currently hosting this website on GitHub Pages, pretty obvious if you look at the URL link of this site. You can check out the repository too.

I have been working my ass off on this website for days now since I got the summer break. Honestly, I have ZERO coding experience in these languages, I just used ChatGPT and some bit of experimenting to make this site look good and work well. But at least I'll pick up some knowledge and hopefully make websites more efficient in the future.

Anyway I gotta go do more stuff my parents gave me. Toodles!
